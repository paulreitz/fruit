## Fruit Data
The first of what will be many projects for collecting and colating data. This one deals with collecting the nutritional value of fruit into a single location and in a more usable and consistant format. 

This information is, of course, available all over the internet. But I've found it's often inconsistant and incomplete. Some sources give only vitamin information, others give more information but in differnt formats. Also, most sources only give a limited number of entries or an inefficient search method to meet my needs.

And there's the format of the information: Some are in PDF format, others are blog posts, or APIs that are overly complex for what I need.

## Why I'm Doing This
The single most difficult thing I've found in attempting to learn machine learning is finding useful and interesting data sets to practice with.

For the most part, the concepts, math and algorithms are easy enough to understand. But, like most skills, require practice. Places like [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) provide a lot of datasets to work with. But sifting through those sets and trying to work in subjects I often don't have enough information on ends up taking up most of my time.

So, using the skills I already have, I'm building my own datasets to practice with. Sure, this isn't a massive dataset, and I'm not going to do anything ground breaking with it. The purpose is to get in some practice and solidify my understanding of the concepts involved.

## Yes, I know...
The subject of this project deals with a very finite amount of data. No matter how many entries I put in the database, there are only so many fruit that exist in the world. 

Because of this, I made some decisions while designing this system that I would **never** make with a larger more open ended set of data. I took some shortcuts that I know I would never get away with when dealing with larger datasets.
